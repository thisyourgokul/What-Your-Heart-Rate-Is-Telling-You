# What-Your-Heart-Rate-Is-Telling-You
Examine the relationship between heart rate and heart disease using multiple logistic regression.


Project Description:

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Researchers are using several data mining techniques to help healthcare professionals in the diagnosis of heart disease. In this project, we will examine the relationship between the maximum heart rate one can achieve during exercise and the likelihood of developing heart disease. Using multiple logistic regression, we will handle the confounding effects of age and gender.
This project uses the Cleveland heart disease dataset.


Project Tasks:

1. Heart disease and potential risk factors
2. Converting diagnosis class into outcome variable
3. Identifying important clinical variables
4. Explore the associations graphically (i)
5. Explore the associations graphically (ii)
6. Explore the associations graphically (iii)
7. Putting all three variables in one model
8. Extracting useful information from the model output
9. Predicted probabilities from our model
10. Model performance metrics
